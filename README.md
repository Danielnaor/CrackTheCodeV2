# Crack the Code - High level plan (old)

## What is Crack the Code?

Crack the Code is a puzzle game that contains combinations/sets of X numbers , Corresponding to these combinations of numbers are hints are given regarding the correctness of these digits/combinations. The goal of the puzzle is to decode the correct code using the combinations of numbers and the hints given. The puzzle is solved when the correct code is decoded.

Each pair of a combination and its corresponding hint forms a clue.

A puzzle will be composed of a multiple clues.

## Examples of a Crack the Code puzzle

### Example 1

```
3 6 8 one number is correct and well placed 
3 8 7 Nothing is correct
2 7 6 One number is correct but wrongly placed
4 7 1 Two numbers are correct but wrongly placed
```

The correct code is 1 6 4

### Example 2

```
3 4 2 One number is correct but wrongly placed
2 7 3 One number is correct but wrongly placed
1 6 5 Two numbers are correct and well placed
8 5 3 Two numbers are correct but wrongly placed
2 6 4 Nothing is correct
```

The correct code is 1 3 5


## Modules of the project

The project will be composed of two modules:

1. A solver that will solve Crack the Code puzzles.
2. A generator that will generate Crack the Code puzzles.

## Solver

The solver will solve Crack the Code puzzles.
the features of the solver will be as follows:

1. The solver will be able to solve puzzles given a set of clues.
2. the length of the code will be determined by the length of the combinations in the clues.
3. the solver will validate that the code is correct by checking if the code satisfies all the clues.

## Generator

The generator will generate Crack the Code puzzles.
The features of the generator are:

1. The generator will be able to generate puzzles with a code with length (the combination will also have the same length) specified by the user.
2. The generator will be able to generate puzzles with several clues specified by the user.

## How are the puzzles solved?

The puzzles are solved by using the clues to eliminate the possible combinations of the code. The solver will use the clues to eliminate the possible combinations of the code to get the smallest amount of possible combinations. The solver will then check if the code satisfies all the clues. If the code satisfies all the clues then the code is the correct code.

### How the solver eliminates possible combinations

The way the solver eliminates possible combinations is by using the clues to eliminate the possible combinations. it will do so by the following steps:

1. find all the clues that their hints say that nothing is correct - ( none of the digits in that clue's combination will be in the code we are solving for) are nothing is correct and eliminate all the instances of the digits in the combinations of the clues from the possible combinations.
for example, if the clue is 1 2 3 nothing is correct and a clue is 1 2 4 one number is correct and well placed the code will replace the 1 and 2 in the clue with -1 to indicate that the numbers are not valid.
2. then the solver will check if there is any clue that was solved
3. then it will check if there are any conflicting cases meaning that there are 2 clues with the number that is the same for both indexes and in one clue the number is correct and well placed and in the other clue the number is correct but wrongly placed. if there is a conflicting case then the number is not gonna be in the code.
4. then it will check if there is any clue that was solved
5. then it will generate all the possible combinations that can be generated from the clues. (all the numbers in the clues are the possible numbers that can be in the code)
6. check each possible combination if it satisfies all the clues. if it does then it is the correct code.

## Recup

The puzzle or riddle structure is as follows:

- Puzzle
  - Clues
        - Combination
        - Hint
