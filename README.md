## Note on the functionality of Version 2 
- **Solver Module:** Highly functional module, was improved and much more effective than in V1, very little can be done to improve the amount of possibilities eliminated using it. 
- **Generator Module:** Not 100% functional. It does its job for the most part, but the Validator module disrupts its work. A more polished experience is planned in the upcoming Version 3.
- **Validator Module:** Currently has some issues - not functional. Version 3 will recreate it with improvements for a better experience.
